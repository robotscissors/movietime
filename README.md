# Movie-Time
This is a full-stack application that leverages an API from a [movie database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3). The API features a community built data-source that began in 2008. To date, the MovieDB has seen over 150,000 users of this metadata source. On average over 1,000 images are added every single day.

## The Task
Create a TV show discovery application. Using any framework or language, create an application to leverage the open-source metadata of the API with the following functional requirements:

### Functional Requirements
1. When the app first loads, there should be a list of popular TV shows (as determined by the API) and a search bar.
2. Upon using the search bar, the user should see a list of shows that match the seach criteria.
3. After clicking on a TV show (from the search or main page) the user should be taken to a page with more information about that particular TV show.

### Technical Requirements
- Create a full-stack application with a backend that communicates with the [movie API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).
- The front-end should be intuitive to use.
- Make sure your code includes a full test suite.
- Deploy your site to a webhost.
